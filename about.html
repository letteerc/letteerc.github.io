	    	<p id="about1">Hello! I am an aspiring UX designer currently enrolled in the MSI program at The University of Michigan School of Information. I graduated from Michigan in 2018 where I majored in International Studies with a focus in Humanitarian Crises. During undergrad, I spent a semester at Yonsei University in Seoul. After working in political campaigning for a few months, I realized I was in the wrong career and began looking at grad school options. I remembered discussing the UI and UX of a tool used in one of my classes for comparing countries, and found the MSI program at Michigan to align with my interests.</p>

	    	<p id="about2">After graduating, I spent the summer working for the Nam Center for Korean Studies at The University of Michigan as a cultural liaison in the Summer in Michigan program. In this role, I was a cultural guide for students attending a one-month intensive English language program. I worked in this role with the Nam Center in the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019. At the conclusion of the program in 2018, I began working for the Elissa Slotkin congressional campaign in Michigan's 8th district. I am proud to have participated in the campaign which had one of the largest swings between 2016 and the midterms and to have helped put my candidate in congress.</p>
	    	<p id="about3">In my free time, I enjoy too much coffee, baking, ice hockey, go-karting, watching every session of Formula 1, listening to and playing music, video games, and netflix binges. I've recently been participating in the Insider Program for the PC edition of Halo: The Master Chief Collection (though I don't think this will fit on my resume), own-goaling in Rocket League, learning Ableton Live for the third time, while practicing my Korean listening through whatever the top rated shows on Netflix are. Also recently became addicted to Terrace House.</p>
